                Each week you pick ONE team to win their match. If they win, you
                are through to the next round to pick again. If they lose or
                draw, you are out. What's makes Last Man Standing interesting is
                you cannot pick the same team twice, so it's all about strategy!

                The idea for our service was born from personal experience.
                Being involved in sporting clubs here in Dublin,
                <br /> fundraising is always tough to think of, and even harder
                to run. While the competition is a great way to generate funds,
                <br /> the backend running always took up lots of time of
                volunteers in the club. We thought there must be a better way to
                <br /> automate this process for people, and make it more
                accessible - And Play Last Man was born. While the competition
