          <h5>Why do we exist?</h5>
          <p>
            The idea for our service was born from personal experience. Being{" "}
            <br /> involved in sporting clubs here in Dublin, fundraising is
            always tough <br /> to think of, and even harder to run. While the
            competition is a great <br /> way to generate funds, the backend
            running always took up lots of <br /> time of volunteers in the
            club. We thought there must be a better way <br /> to automate this
            process for people, and make it more accessible - <br /> And Play
            Last Man was born.
